# AS-Calculator
 Android Studio Calculator Project

This project is my attempt to build a sample calculator using Android Studio UI and Java code.
Unfortunately I was unable to work out the parentheses functionalities, however everything else works properly including:
Calculating multiple operations at a time
Backspacing
Clearing
Finding the final result

Feel free to use my code as you please, and if you are able to build the parentheses functionalities, I would greatly appreciate knowing how you did it.
